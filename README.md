NUBU is a personal nutrition tracking tool that helps you understand what you're eating, identify nutrient gaps, and build better habits over time.

## What It Does

- **Natural language food logging** - Just say what you ate ("2 eggs, toast with jelly, black tea")
- **Full nutrient analysis** - Tracks 26+ nutrients including vitamins, minerals, and macros
- **Saved meals** - Store common meals so you don't retype them every day
- **Gap detection** - Highlights nutrients you're low on and suggests foods to fix it
- **Visual dashboard** - Color-coded progress bars show where you stand daily

## Tracked Nutrients

**Macros:** Calories, Protein, Fat, Saturated Fat, Carbs, Fiber, Sugar

**Vitamins:** A, C, D, E, K1, K2, Thiamin, Riboflavin, Niacin, B6, Folate, B12

**Minerals:** Calcium, Iron, Magnesium, Phosphorus, Potassium, Sodium, Zinc, Selenium
